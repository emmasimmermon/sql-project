**What problem are we solving?**  
As ethical values become more central to consumer behavior, companies need data-driven insight into how brand ethics impact product reviews, buyer trust, and guest sentiment.

**How are we solving it?**  
By building a reproducible ETL pipeline that collects, processes, and analyzes customer reviews and brand metadata. Results are visualized in dashboards using Looker Studio.
